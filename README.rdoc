This is a visualization of rent and crime by neighborhood in Los Angeles, California

The project is a single page interactive experience that represents information in a database through a map and charts.

Built with RoR, Javascript, Google Maps API V3, Google Charts Visualizations, SQLite/PostgreSQL, and of course HTML/CSS.

A Heroku deployment has been tested and works as expected. Use at your own risk.
